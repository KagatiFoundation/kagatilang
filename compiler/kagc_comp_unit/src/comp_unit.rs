/// Represents a single source file's state throughout the compilation pipeline.
///
/// A `CompilationUnit` encapsulates all the intermediate data derived from
/// processing a single source file, from its raw source code to the parsed
/// abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
///
/// It is created from a [`SourceFile`] and is gradually enriched as the compiler
/// advances through its stages:
///
/// 1. **Loading** – The raw file contents are read into `source`.
/// 2. **Lexing** – The source text is tokenized into `tokens`.
/// 3. **Parsing** – Tokens are transformed into an AST representation (`asts`).
/// 4. **Semantic Analysis** – The ASTs are type-checked and linked with imported units.
/// 5. **Code Generation** – Lowered IR or machine code is generated from the validated AST.
///
/// A `CompilationUnit` also stores:
/// - `meta_id` – An internal unique identifier for bookkeeping.
/// - `imports` – A list of modules or files this unit depends on.
/// - `stage` – Tracks how far along in the compilation process this unit is.
/// - `tokens` – The tokenized form of the source, shared via `Rc` for reuse.
/// - `asts` – The parsed representation of this unit (and optionally its imports).
///
/// Multiple `CompilationUnit`s are managed together by the compiler to support
/// multi-file projects, incremental compilation, and dependency resolution.
