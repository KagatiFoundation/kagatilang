# Prototype Playground

This folder contains **prototyping and experimental code** written in different programming languages.  
It is **not part of the actual compiler** and should not be treated as production code.  

## Purpose
- Test out algorithms, data structures, or language features quickly.  
- Explore ideas that might later be integrated into the compiler.  
- Compare how different languages handle the same concept.  
- Keep the main compiler codebase clean and focused.  

## Notes
- Code here may be incomplete, buggy, or inconsistent.  
- There are **no guarantees** about coding style, correctness, or compatibility.  
- Some files may duplicate logic that already exists elsewhere in the project â€” this is intentional for experimentation.  
- Nothing in this folder should be imported or used directly by the compiler.  

## Suggested Workflow
1. Use this folder to try out an idea in isolation.  
2. If it works and feels useful, refactor it and move it into the compiler source tree.  
3. Leave the prototype here as a reference if you like, but **do not rely on it** in the main build.
